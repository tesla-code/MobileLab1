Floats lead to inaccurate calculations, witch could lead to the loss or gain of money inn the system
witch would be a disaster for the system.


How will you convert back-and-forth from Integer to a currency that has two decimal places in the UI for the user?

You can use mod 100, and simply have the whole calulation logic be based on the last decmial places in the number,
