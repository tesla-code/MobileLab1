Tested the code on andorid stuido.

Virtual Device used:
    Nexus 5X API 28




To test the extra Feature some code has to be uncommented:

The assignmnet has one extrea feature that randomly generates 1-10 euros and 
adds it to the blance. But this needs to be uncommented to work.
    - uncomment volatile keywords in front of variables balance and cents
    - uncomment
        // FoundsRaiser f  = new FoundsRaiser();
        // f.start();
     in MainActivity

    - uncomment FoundRaiser Class in MainActivity
    - uncomment noitfyViewChange() method  in MainActivity
